This is a simple game where you press a button on a gamepad
and the interface highlights it and plays a popping sound.

The game uses the first connected gamepad. Sticks are not supported,
only buttons. You can also use WASD and IJKL keys on the keyboard if you
don't have a gamepad, but it kind of defeats the purpose :).

The game is aimed at a child of around 2 year of age as a
guide for connecting tactile and hearing senses with an occasional
glance at the screen.
